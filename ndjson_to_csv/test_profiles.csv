I build credibility, relevancy, and industry recognition.

Allow me to save you some time….

I won’t bore you with an ‘About’ section that serves to build my authority.

You’ve already established that.

Instead, let me paint a picture of what you can expect.

Visualise with me…

Imagine being recognised as an industry leader by your colleagues, peers, clients, partners, and community.

Imagine having the reputation of being the credible go-to person because of your relevant and genuine expertise. “Speak to (insert your name) they’ll know what to do”.

Imagine attending your next event and strangers approach you, thanking you for the valuable content you’re always posting and how it has helped them.

Imagine being frequently headhunted by organisations that you have long respected and admired.

Imagine receiving frequent calls from top-talent in your industry who have been following you and would love to work with you.

Imagine receiving frequent messages to speak at the next industry event, be part of an expert panel, or be interviewed on a leading podcast.

Well stop imagining.

After spending countless hours on LinkedIn trying to understand how to best use it, leverage it, and to what end?

I quickly learned that it is NOT about “likes”, “comments”, or social media clout.

It is about credibility, relevancy, and industry recognition.

When used correctly, it becomes your most powerful leadership, connection, and communication tool that expedites your career and business goals.

I say that with conviction as I’ve personally done it.

That’s important to know!!

Now….let me help you do the same.

We can work together in one of two ways: 

1️⃣ 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝟭:𝟭 𝗣𝗼𝘄𝗲𝗿 𝗛𝗼𝘂𝗿 - A one hour LinkedIn strategy call. I provide guidance on how you can best leverage Linkedin, and your personal brand. Book a call at https://calendly.com/ahmadimam/power-hour

2️⃣ 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗕𝗿𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗖𝗿𝗲𝗱𝗶𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝗦𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗶𝗰𝗲 - We become your trusted LinkedIn partner managing your personal brand, content, and strategy from end-to-end including leveraging our extensive global networks.

We know what branding success looks like, and we know how to harness it.

Industry leaders are not satisfied with “good enough”.

They know what they deserve, and they raise their standards to achieve it.

Curating, licensing, and editing an enormous volume of clips while striving to provide my clients with only the best videos possible.\n\nEventually, I scaled this start-up from a 2 person operation in my downtown apartment, to a full office with 30 in-house employees. \n\nMy day-to-day included overseeing the creative staff, as well as handling client relations. \n\nBy early 2018, I had distributed tens of thousands of videos to various blogs across social media, and achieved tens of billions of views cumulatively for my clients. \n\nI learned what attracts attention online and what doesn't. \n\nNaturally, this led me back to creating my own content once again, to grow my personal brand. \n\nIn less than 18 months, I grew a following of over 100k on LinkedIn.\n\nI now specialize in assisting others to get the reach they deserve on this platform.\n\nPM me to see how I can help!\ud83d\udc46"", ""location"": ""Milwaukee, WI"", ""company"": ""Margle Media"", ""title"": ""COO & co-Founder""}], ""company"": {""name"": ""Margle"", ""logo"": ""https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4D0BAQEalph6RtZmdQ/company-logo_400_400/0/1594046762805?e=1701302400&v=beta&t=n0lh2rLSct8rQVeljym-tiIC6t5GRJAyilzfSZ20UBw"", ""id"": 24978804, ""employees"": {""start"": 11, ""end"": 50}, ""url"": ""https://www.linkedin.com/company/margle-media/""}}, {""date"": {""start"": {""month"": null, ""year"": 2012, ""day"": null}, ""end"": {""month"": 4, ""year"": 2016, ""day"": null}}, ""profile_positions"": [{""date"": {""start"": {""month"": null, ""year"": 2012, ""day"": null}, ""end"": {""month"": 4, ""year"": 2016, ""day"": null}}, ""employment_type"": null, ""description"": ""I have always been passionate about music and songwriting.

founder of All We Have Is Now (AWHIN, Inc), a consultancy created to help companies unleash the power of new technology, with a focus on making better products and services and on consumer centricity.

I'm the host of ""The Edge"", an original series on Euronews which reaches 250 million households, explores the future of business and culture through technology and spotlights the companies and people taking bold leaps into what’s next.

And recently I wrote  Digital Darwinism, a business book that has been translated into seven languages, now in a brand new edition.

As you can see I've got 700,000 followers on here, after being voted as the #1 Voice in Marketing. I'm a global Keynote speaker, delivering over 100 keynote speeches at leading public and private events across more than 42 countries.  I like to span the gap between pundit and practitioner. 

I now advise Fortune 500 companies and startups on business transformation and innovation. As a proponent of “nowism,” a more practical form of futurism, I think that we have all the technology we need at our disposal and we can drive meaningful growth by taking action and using our imagination to unleash its power. 

Over the past 20 years, I've built a career spanning digital, creative/advertising, and media agencies, and studied the impact of new technology, new consumer behaviors, and changing rules of business. 

This experience informs my work in digital transformation and innovation. My work has been referenced in The New York Times and The Economist. I've published over 500 articles in publications including The Guardian, TechCrunch, Forbes, Digiday, Quartz, Marketing Week, Adweek, and the World Economic Forum. 

I don't know more than others, but I know enough to ask good questions and listen to those who know more about things.  My style is provocative.

Nine labs competed in many races through complex off-road terrain over the course of 3 years. In the first year, our team achieved the competition's 3-year goal of improving the baseline run-time by a factor of 2, forcing the government to up the goal to a factor of 3. \n\nUsing visual input for navigation is essential in unstructured outdoor environments, which can cause simpler sensors such as GPS, odometry, and laser scanners to drift severely or become unusably noisy. As an alternative to such sensors, I contributed a novel, fast form of visual odometry. Our efficient \u201chybrid visual odometry\u201d method used 5% of the CPU time, in contrast to full VO methods which require an entire CPU. Despite this, it maintained comparable accuracy to full VO over diverse terrain types. This makes it particularly suitable for consumer robots, extraterrestrial rovers, and other platforms with limited computing power. \n\nThis contribution was described in the ICRA 2009 paper Efficient Off-Road Localization Using Visually Corrected Odometry, and contributed to our JFR 2009 paper, A Multi-Range Architecture for Collision-Free Off-Road Robot Navigation."", ""contributors"": [{""name"": null, ""last_name"": ""LeCun"", ""type"": ""standardizedContributor"", ""first_name"": ""Yann"", ""headline"": ""VP & Chief AI Scientist at Meta""}, {""name"": null, ""last_name"": ""Grimes"", ""type"": ""standardizedContributor"", ""first_name"": ""Matthew"", ""headline"": ""Research Scientist at DeepMind""}, {""name"": null, ""last_name"": ""Scoffier"", ""type"": ""standardizedContributor"", ""first_name"": ""Marco"", ""headline"": ""AI Infrastructure Team at NVIDIA""}, {""name"": null, ""last_name"": ""Erkan"", ""type"": ""standardizedContributor"", ""first_name"": ""Ay\u015fe Naz"", ""headline"": ""Applied AI/ML || ML Engineering Management || ML Product Management""}, {""name"": null, ""last_name"": ""Muller"", ""type"": ""standardizedContributor"", ""first_name"": ""Urs"", ""headline"": ""Senior Director of System Software/Chief Architect-Autonomous Driving""}, {""name"": ""Raia Hadsell"", ""last_name"": null, ""type"": ""nonStandardizedContributor"", ""first_name"": null, ""headline"": null}], ""title"": ""LAGR""}, {""date"": {""start"": {""month"": 4, ""year"": 1997, ""day"": null}, ""end"": {""month"": 1, ""year"": 2002, ""day"": null}}, ""description"": ""DjVu (pronounced \""d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu\"") is a digital document format with advanced compression technology.\n\nI initiated and directed the project."", ""contributors"": [{""name"": null, ""last_name"": ""LeCun"", ""type"": ""standardizedContributor"", ""first_name"": ""Yann"", ""headline"": ""VP & Chief AI Scientist at Meta""}, {""name"": null, ""last_name"": ""Haffner"", ""type"": ""standardizedContributor"", ""first_name"": ""Patrick"", ""headline"": ""Human-in-the-loop ML at AWS""}, {""name"": null, ""last_name"": ""Howard"", ""type"": ""standardizedContributor"", ""first_name"": ""Paul"", ""headline"": ""Retired Software Engineer""}, {""name"": null, ""last_name"": ""Riemers"", ""type"": ""standardizedContributor"", ""first_name"": ""Bill C."", ""headline"": ""Senior Principal Software Engineer at Red Hat""}, {""name"": null, ""last_name"": ""Vincent"", ""type"": ""standardizedContributor"", ""first_name"": ""Luc"", ""headline"": ""CPTO @ Hayden AI | Formerly VP of AI @ Meta | ex-Google, ex-Lyft | Angel Investor, Advisor, Board Member""}], ""title"": ""DjVu""}, {""date"": {""start"": {""month"": 7, ""year"": 1991, ""day"": null}, ""end"": {""month"": 4, ""year"": 1996, ""day"": null}}, ""description"": ""The first practical system for reading the amount on bank checks.\nIt was deployed by NCR first in ATM machines in 1995, then in high-speed check reading machines in 1996.

My work is featured in Business Insider, CNBC, and Entrepreneur dot com.

Email is the best way to contact me: tim@timdenning.com

I am an expert in blogging after writing daily for 9 years on platforms like LinkedIn.
I am a teacher who has built a highly successful online training academy. 
I have written several published eBooks about social media. 
I am an expert in sales after working in the field for 16 years across banking and technology.

I tell you none of this to brag. I tell you because I've done the actual work and produced results you can mimic.

My vision is:
To inspire the world through entrepreneurship, technology, and personal development.

My beliefs that drive everything I do are:
- Anything is possible
- Positivity trumps all
- Challenge the status quo
- Ego is the enemy
- Always be kind, grateful, and a good person

How can I help you?
- If you want to up your game in social media, then I can help.
- If you need help putting together and executing a digital strategy, then I can help
- If you are obsessed with personal development, then we’ll probably become friends quickly.

My name is Cory and I’m thrilled you want to know about me. I’m a serial entrepreneur and startup mentor obsessed with UBI, web3, blockchain, AI, the metaverse, kindness, animals, humanity and our earth. I’ll keep it fairly brief here, but feel free to DM/InMail me if anything resonates with or intrigues you.

I WISH I COULD ACCEPT ALL YOUR CONNECTION REQUESTS BUT AM AT LINKEDIN LIMIT. I’ll happily follow back all profiles that pass my sniff test.

Firstly, I am still selectively creating Linkedin influencers as a 1:1 coach but also have a free community here: Linktips LinkedIn Tips, as well as a masterclass replay video for sale for $750 as two more approachable ways to learn my tips and tricks intended to help even more people.

Secondly, I am cofounder at DCRBN (https://dcrbn.io) — a web3 launchpad helping incubate, scale, connect, fund and support innovative tech companies committed to building net-neutral/eco-sustainably.

Along these lines, I am also EIR at the Founder Institute where I’ve also served as coMD and Mentor in Excellence.

Additionally, I am serving as Chief Growth Officer at Agora World (https://agoravr.world) — a NO CODE, drag-and-drop freemium metaverse creation platform changing the game and lowering barriers to enter the metaverse.

I’m also on the advisory board of 2 nonprofits, The Artest Foundation founded by Ron “Meta Worldpeace” Artest Jr. and World Game Changers CIC.

I am also global general manager at Inf4mation, the Thought Leader of NFTs and web3 at Global AI Hub, a keynote speaker, A.I. automation and prompt expert, podcast Host at Coryconnects podcast, and probably a few more things too.

I hope you enjoy my content and community. I AM NOT A FINANCIAL ADVISOR, I DON’T OFFER FINANCIAL ADVICE. Don’t make investment decisions based solely on anything I discuss here.

My prayer is for unity, peace, universal basic income, the ethical advancement of AI, freedom and LOVE for all.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/corywarfield,,"Professional Training & Coaching,Startups,Technology,Venture Capital,Entrepreneurship,Accelerators,Incubators,Business Development,Startup",False,cory@inf4mation.com,3.4923412532549745,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D4D16AQFNDykc5ZhXDg/profile-displaybackgroundimage-shrink_350_1400/0/1669486764855?e=1699488000&v=beta&t=qvrfGsUS5cYHWjvkqTzBwhT8djiYr8jV8cpddNLS7Jg,2,iNf4mation.com,False,3106,Illinois,4,corywarfield,Chicago,ACoAABy2T8cBH8cPpXqYtbUI2gA1BbZdqpgkn6k,False,True,,Computer Software,12,Warfield,3.605958697981716,True,0.5696112521161579,

Then, in 2019, I burned out.

So, I decided to walk away from my high-paying executive job.

But, before I could, I had a hypothesis.

I believed building an audience online would be an incredible asset. That attention was the new currency and would play a major part in my success as an entrepreneur.

So, I started building my brand on LinkedIn in early 2019. 

And the results were pretty phenomenal.

In just 6 months I grew from zero followers to over 20,000.

And on August 1st of 2019, I walked away from my executive role at a fast-growing startup.

Since that day, I've spent my time building a number of one-person Internet businesses.

My mission is to be the ""Diversified Solopreneur."" 

My results:

→ $4.2M in business revenue at a 94% profit margin.
→ 435k+ people following my journey on LinkedIn
→ 405k+ people following my journey on Twitter
→ 150,000+ people read my weekly newsletter
→ 500M+ impressions in the last 4 years

If you want to learn more about how I did this, you can take one of my self-guided courses.

When I was 16 years old, my therapist presented me with 5 clothespins to pick from. Each one had a word engraved on them: Love❤️, Vulnerability🌈, Freedom🕊, Courage🌸, and Authenticity⭐️. At the time I didn’t know why, but I chose the one with Freedom. 

As I got older, I had someone ask me, “What’s your dream in one word?” Instantly Freedom came to mind, and it made me realize I was on this Earth to create an impact, not just an income. When I meet someone new I always like to ask them the same question that was asked to me. To my surprise, no one ever mentioned their job as their dream, but rather love, creation, happiness, time, equality, but never their job.🍀

Society teaches us that the traditional way in life is to go to college, get a degree, and get a job, but what if that path isn’t the right route for everyone. I truly do believe that education is important, but it isn’t knowledge that is power, it is the application of knowledge that garners results. 🏆

I didn’t get any of my jobs because I had a degree from a top tier school or because I had connections, but rather it was through the power of networking🗣, persistence💪, and the best asset is the will not skill🧠. I always tell my employers during interviews that I may not have the skillsets, but I do have the mindset. You can teach me how to do the job, but you cannot teach me character, that comes straight from within. We all were once nobodies that somebody took a chance on. And I want to be that somebody for someone out there.👫

I live by the motto “If it ain’t a hell yes, it’s a hell no.”💃I don’t believe in doing anything that does not align with my core values which are passion, creativity, authenticity, vulnerability, integrity, and most importantly Freedom. I am a firm believer that money💸does not dictate how successful I am in life, but rather by how passionate and fulfilled I am in my personal and professional life doing what I love, surrounded by like-minded individuals.🧘‍♀️✨

I am currently a Recruiter @ Lockheed Martin ✈️ where I help people find jobs that would align with their career goals. My intention is to create a positive candidate experience for each person to know that someone is on their side.🙋‍♀️I believe in treating my candidates as an individual and never as a transaction. 🤝

Thank you for taking your time to view my profile. Unfortunately, I can no longer accept any new connection requests. Therefore, I'd really appreciate it if you could follow me. Let's keep in touch!

---

I am a business developer, sales professional, and FinTech strategist who strives to make an impact and change the world. For the better.

Although I have a bachelor's degree in Economics (with a major in Economics and Politics), I have been actively following and/or working in the Financial Services field since the very first year at university.

Because of the early start of my career and given opportunities to try myself out in different roles and different players in the world of finance (I worked at Western Union, Danske Bank, Norne Securities), quite quickly and easily I found myself being the most passionate about Financial Technology and its enormous potential to reinvent conventional finance and change the world for the better.

Now I am working in FinTech for more than 6 years, and every day I try to be a bit better and learn something new (and there are lots to learn!).

Currently, I am a part of Flutterwave, where I am scaling the business and leading company's expansion into Europe. Flutterwave is a Mastercard, VISA, Greycroft, Y Combinator, and Worldpay FIS-backed payments technology company headquartered in San Francisco. We're simplifying payments for endless possibilities. Flutterwave is trusted by leading companies like Uber, Facebook, TransferWise, Netflix, Jumia, Azimo, Binance, among other 90,000+ businesses. We were recognized as the #2 Most Innovative Company in Africa in 2019, according to Fast Company. We're part of 50 Future Unicorns🦄 according to CB Insights & Fast Company. Also, CNBC has included us in the Upstart 100, which lists the brightest, most intriguing, young startups promising to become the great companies of tomorrow. I am super excited to play an important part in the Financial Technology revolution, and having the ability to move the financial disruption forward.

I am highly interested in FinTech/TechFin, digital innovation (especially in banking, payments, and finance per see), and emerging technologies.
